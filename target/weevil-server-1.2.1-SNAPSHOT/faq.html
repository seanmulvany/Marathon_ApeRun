        <h4 class="question">How many pledges can I place?</h4>
        <div class="answer">There's no limit on how many pledges you can make or on the total value. The more pledges, the more my motivation to finish the race!</div>

        <h4 class="question">When is it?</h4>
        <div class="answer">Dublin City Marathon takes place on Sunday October 30th. You can place pledges any time from now and during the
            race.</div>

        <h4 class="question">Where will my money go?</h4>
        <div class="answer">Payments will be sent (when you pay yourself!) to Children's Medical and Research Foundation in Crumlin Hospital.</div>

        <h4 class="question">Do I pay before or after the event?</h4>
        <div class="answer">After, once you see how many of your pledges I collect. Of course, if you're feeling generous, we won't
            stop you donating everything!</div>

        <h4 class="question">What happens if I don't pay what you've collected?</h4>
        <div class="answer">Nothing at all; this is all honour-based. Of course, if you've gotten this far, we know you're a nice
            person!</div>

        <h4 class="question">How can we see where you are?</h4>
        <div class="answer">I have smartphones that use GPS and relay my positions to the aperun servers. You'll be able to follow
            me on the map during training and the marathon itself.</div>

        <h4 class="question">How does all this sorcery work? Are you from the future?</h4>
        <div class="answer">Goodness, no! We just the made the most of some very clever technology, including JavaScript,
            geo-location browser extensions, jQuery, Google Maps, Google App Engine and Android (lots of Android...).</div>

        <h4 class="question">Are my credit card details safe?</h4>
        <div class="answer">We don't handle the credit card transaction here; we'll just send you to the charity's secure payment site
            when it's time to make the payment.</div>

        <h4 class="question">What's all this about maps and apes and other mumbo jumbo? Can't I just donate some money?</h4>
        <div class="answer">We hope you'll enjoy the fun of the event, but we understand if you're busy! Straight donations to our
            charity are, of course, very welcome.</div>

        <h4 class="question">What do I do if I have a problem with the site?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
