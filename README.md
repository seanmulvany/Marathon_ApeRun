# Marathon_ApeRun

Java web service running on Google AppEngine cloud service. Data is stored using the Google nosql datastore (Google Datastore) 
and JSON http APIs serve the data to the donor webviews and the Android app (not attached).

Donors can drop virtual pledges for a charity of the runner’s choice  on a map where they appear as markers with monetary values attached. 
Donors can watch “runners” live go through these spots where the pledges/markers are and watch them collect them. Collection of a marker 
confers a social onus on the donor to donate this to the runners chosen charity. At the end of a race, donors get an email saying they 
pledged X of which Y was collected inviting them to go directly to the charity website and donate Y.
